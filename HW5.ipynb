'tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, nor customary suits of solemn black, nor windy suspiration of forced breath, no, nor the fruitful river in the eye, nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, that can denote me truly: these indeed seem, for they are actions that a man might play: but i have that within which passeth show; these but the trappings and the suits of woe. i shall in all my best obey you, madam. o, that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew! or that the everlasting had not fix'd his canon 'gainst self-slaughter! o god! god! how weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, seem to me all the uses of this world! fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, that grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature possess it merely. that it should come to this! but two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: so excellent a king; that was, to this, hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly. heaven and earth! must i remember? why, she would hang on him, as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on: and yet, within a month-- let me not think on't--frailty, thy name is woman!-- a little month, or ere those shoes were old with which she follow'd my poor father's body, like niobe, all tears:--why she, even she-- o, god! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle, my father's brother, but no more like my father than i to hercules: within a month: ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes, she married. o, most wicked speed, to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets! it is not nor it cannot come to good: but break, my heart; for i must hold my tongue. i am glad to see you well: horatio,--or i do forget myself. sir, my good friend; i'll change that name with you: and what make you from wittenberg, horatio? marcellus? i am very glad to see you. good even, sir. but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg? i would not hear your enemy say so, nor shall you do mine ear that violence, to make it truster of your own report against yourself: i know you are no truant. but what is your affair in elsinore? we'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. i pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; i think it was to see my mother's wedding. thrift, thrift, horatio! the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day, horatio! my father!--methinks i see my father. in my mind's eye, horatio. he was a man, take him for all in all, i shall not look upon his like again. saw? who? the king my father! for god's love, let me hear. but where was this? did you not speak to it? 'tis very strange. indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. hold you the watch to-night? arm'd, say you? from top to toe? then saw you not his face? what, look'd he frowningly? pale or red? and fix'd his eyes upon you? i would i had been there. very like, very like. stay'd it long? his beard was grizzled--no? i will watch to-night; perchance 'twill walk again. if it assume my noble father's person, i'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace. i pray you all, if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, let it be tenable in your silence still; and whatsoever else shall hap to-night, give it an understanding, but no tongue: i will requite your loves. so, fare you well: upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, i'll visit you. your loves, as mine to you: farewell. my father's spirit in arms! all is not well; i doubt some foul play: would the night were come! till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. the air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. what hour now? no, it is struck. the king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; and, as he drains his draughts of rhenish down, the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge. ay, marry, is't: but to my mind, though i am native here and to the manner born, it is a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance. this heavy-headed revel east and west makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations: they clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase soil our addition; and indeed it takes from our achievements, though perform'd at height, the pith and marrow of our attribute. so, oft it chances in particular men, that for some vicious mole of nature in them, as, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty, since nature cannot choose his origin-- by the o'ergrowth of some complexion, oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens the form of plausive manners, that these men, carrying, i say, the stamp of one defect, being nature's livery, or fortune's star,-- their virtues else--be they as pure as grace, as infinite as man may undergo-- shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault: the dram of eale doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal. angels and ministers of grace defend us! be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, be thy intents wicked or charitable, thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee: i'll call thee hamlet, king, father, royal dane: o, answer me! let me not burst in ignorance; but tell why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, to cast thee up again. what may this mean, that thou, dead corse, again in complete steel revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon, making night hideous; and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? it will not speak; then i will follow it. why, what should be the fear? i do not set my life in a pin's fee; and for my soul, what can it do to that, being a thing immortal as itself? it waves me forth again: i'll follow it. it waves me still. go on; i'll follow thee. hold off your hands. my fate cries out, and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion's nerve. still am i call'd. unhand me, gentlemen. by heaven, i'll make a ghost of him that lets me! i say, away! go on; i'll follow thee. where wilt thou lead me? speak; i'll go no further. i will. alas, poor ghost! speak; i am bound to hear. what? o god! murder! haste me to know't, that i, with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love, may sweep to my revenge. o my prophetic soul! my uncle! o all you host of heaven! o earth! what else? and shall i couple hell? o, fie! hold, hold, my heart; and you, my sinews, grow not instant old, but bear me stiffly up. remember thee! ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe. remember thee! yea, from the table of my memory i'll wipe away all trivial fond records, all saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, that youth and observation copied there; and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain, unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! o most pernicious woman! o villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! my tables,--meet it is i set it down, that one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; at least i'm sure it may be so in denmark: so, uncle, there you are. now to my word; it is 'adieu, adieu! remember me.' i have sworn 't. so be it! hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. o, wonderful! no; you'll reveal it. how say you, then; would heart of man once think it? but you'll be secret? there's ne'er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he's an arrant knave. why, right; you are i' the right; and so, without more circumstance at all, i hold it fit that we shake hands and part: you, as your business and desire shall point you; for every man has business and desire, such as it is; and for mine own poor part, look you, i'll go pray. i'm sorry they offend you, heartily; yes, 'faith heartily. yes, by saint patrick, but there is, horatio, and much offence too. touching this vision here, it is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: for your desire to know what is between us, o'ermaster 't as you may. and now, good friends, as you are friends, scholars and soldiers, give me one poor request. never make known what you have seen to-night. nay, but swear't. upon my sword. indeed, upon my sword, indeed. ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage-- consent to swear. never to speak of this that you have seen, swear by my sword. hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. come hither, gentlemen, and lay your hands again upon my sword: never to speak of this that you have heard, swear by my sword. well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? a worthy pioner! once more remove, good friends. and therefore as a stranger give it welcome. there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. but come; here, as before, never, so help you mercy, how strange or odd soe'er i bear myself, as i perchance hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on, that you, at such times seeing me, never shall, with arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake, or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, as 'well, well, we know,' or 'we could, an if we would,' or 'if we list to speak,' or 'there be, an if they might,' or such ambiguous giving out, to note that you know aught of me: this not to do, so grace and mercy at your most need help you, swear. rest, rest, perturbed spirit! so, gentlemen, with all my love i do commend me to you: and what so poor a man as hamlet is may do, to express his love and friending to you, god willing, shall not lack. let us go in together; and still your fingers on your lips, i pray. the time is out of joint: o cursed spite, that ever i was born to set it right! nay, come, let's go together. well, god-a-mercy. excellent well; you are a fishmonger. then i would you were so honest a man. ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god kissing carrion,--have you a daughter? let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive. friend, look to 't. words, words, words. between who? slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though i most powerfully and potently believe, yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be old as i am, if like a crab you could go backward. into my grave. you cannot, sir, take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life. these tedious old fools! my excellent good friends! how dost thou, guildenstern? ah, rosencrantz! good lads, how do ye both? nor the soles of her shoe? then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours? in the secret parts of fortune? o, most true; she is a strumpet. what's the news? then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison hither? denmark's a prison. a goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, denmark being one o' the worst. why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison. o god, i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that i have bad dreams. a dream itself is but a shadow. then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. shall we to the court? for, by my fay, i cannot reason. no such matter: i will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, i am most dreadfully attended. but, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at elsinore? beggar that i am, i am even poor in thanks; but i thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. were you not sent for? is it your own inclining? is it a free visitation? come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. why, any thing, but to the purpose. you were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: i know the good king and queen have sent for you. that you must teach me. but let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?   nay, then, i have an eye of you.--if you love me, hold not off. i will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. i have of late--but wherefore i know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. what a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so. why did you laugh then, when i said 'man delights not me'? he that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. what players are they? how chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city? are they so followed? how comes it? do they grow rusty? what, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players--as it is most like, if their means are no better--their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession? is't possible? do the boys carry it away? it is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. 'sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. gentlemen, you are welcome to elsinore. your hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, i tell you, must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. you are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived. i am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw. hark you, guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts. i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. you say right, sir: o' monday morning; 'twas so indeed. my lord, i have news to tell you. when roscius was an actor in rome,-- buz, buz! then came each actor on his ass,-- o jephthah, judge of israel, what a treasure hadst thou! why, 'one fair daughter and no more, the which he loved passing well.' am i not i' the right, old jephthah? nay, that follows not. why, 'as by lot, god wot,' and then, you know, 'it came to pass, as most like it was,'-- the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes. you are welcome, masters; welcome, all. i am glad to see thee well. welcome, good friends. o, my old friend! thy face is valenced since i saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in denmark? what, my young lady and mistress! by'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. pray god, your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. masters, you are all welcome. we'll e'en to't like french falconers, fly at any thing we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech. i heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, i remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it was--as i received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. i remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. one speech in it i chiefly loved: 'twas aeneas' tale to dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see-- 'the rugged pyrrhus, like the hyrcanian beast,'-- it is not so:--it begins with pyrrhus:-- 'the rugged pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, black as his purpose, did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse, hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd with heraldry more dismal; head to foot now is he total gules; horridly trick'd with blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, baked and impasted with the parching streets, that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire, and thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore, with eyes like carbuncles, the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks.' so, proceed you. it shall to the barber's, with your beard. prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on: come to hecuba. 'the mobled queen?' 'tis well: i'll have thee speak out the rest soon. good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. god's bodykins, man, much better: use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. take them in. follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the murder of gonzago? we'll ha't to-morrow night. you could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which i would set down and insert in't, could you not? very well. follow that lord; and look you mock him not. my good friends, i'll leave you till night: you are welcome to elsinore. ay, so, god be wi' ye; now i am alone. o, what a rogue and peasant slave am i! is it not monstrous that this player here, but in a fiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wann'd, tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, a broken voice, and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! for hecuba! what's hecuba to him, or he to hecuba, that he should weep for her? what would he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have? he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech, make mad the guilty and appal the free, confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears. yet i, a dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, like john-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, and can say nothing; no, not for a king, upon whose property and most dear life a damn'd defeat was made. am i a coward? who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, as deep as to the lungs? who does me this? ha! 'swounds, i should take it: for it cannot be but i am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall to make oppression bitter, or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! o, vengeance! why, what an ass am i! this is most brave, that i, the son of a dear father murder'd, prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, and fall a-cursing, like a very drab, a scullion! fie upon't! foh! about, my brain! i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim'd their malefactions; for murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle: i'll observe his looks; i'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench, i know my course. the spirit that i have seen may be the devil: and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy, as he is very potent with such spirits, abuses me to damn me: i'll have grounds more relative than this: the play 's the thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king. to be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? to die: to sleep; no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. to die, to sleep; to sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause: there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of? thus conscience does make cowards of us all; and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action.--soft you now! the fair ophelia! nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remember'd. i humbly thank you; well, well, well. no, not i; i never gave you aught. ha, ha! are you honest? are you fair? that if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty. ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. i did love you once. you should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: i loved you not. get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? i am myself indifferent honest; but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: i am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven? we are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. go thy ways to a nunnery. where's your father? let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in's own house. farewell. if thou dost marry, i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. to a nunnery, go, and quickly too. farewell. i have heard of your paintings too, well enough; god has given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name god's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. go to, i'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. i say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. to a nunnery, go. speak the speech, i pray you, as i pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, i had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as i may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. o, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant; it out-herods herod: pray you, avoid it. be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. o, there be players that i have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. o, reform it altogether. and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. go, make you ready. how now, my lord! i will the king hear this piece of work? bid the players make haste. will you two help to hasten them? what ho! horatio! horatio, thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal. nay, do not think i flatter; for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits, to feed and clothe thee? why should the poor be flatter'd? no, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning. dost thou hear? since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish, her election hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been as one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, a man that fortune's buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger to sound what stop she please. give me that man that is not passion's slave, and i will wear him in my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, as i do thee.--something too much of this.-- there is a play to-night before the king; one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father's death: i prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech, it is a damned ghost that we have seen, and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan's stithy. give him heedful note; for i mine eyes will rivet to his face, and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming. they are coming to the play; i must be idle: get you a place. excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: i eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so. no, nor mine now. my lord, you played once i' the university, you say? what did you enact? it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. be the players ready? no, good mother, here's metal more attractive. lady, shall i lie in your lap? i mean, my head upon your lap? do you think i meant country matters? that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. nothing. who, i? o god, your only jig-maker. what should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours. so long? nay then, let the devil wear black, for i'll have a suit of sables. o heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'for, o, for, o, the hobby-horse is forgot.' marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief. we shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all. ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means. is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? as woman's love.   wormwood, wormwood. if she should break it now! madam, how like you this play? o, but she'll keep her word. no, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world. the mouse-trap. marry, how? tropically. this play is the image of a murder done in vienna: gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung. this is one lucianus, nephew to the king. i could interpret between you and your love, if i could see the puppets dallying. it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge. so you must take your husbands. begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. come: 'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.' he poisons him i' the garden for's estate. his name's gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in choice italian: you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago's wife. what, frighted with false fire! why, let the stricken deer go weep, the hart ungalled play; for some must watch, while some must sleep: so runs the world away. would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me--with two provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir? a whole one, i. for thou dost know, o damon dear, this realm dismantled was of jove himself; and now reigns here a very, very--pajock. o good horatio, i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. didst perceive? upon the talk of the poisoning? ah, ha! come, some music! come, the recorders! for if the king like not the comedy, why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy. come, some music! sir, a whole history. ay, sir, what of him? with drink, sir? your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler. i am tame, sir: pronounce. you are welcome. sir, i cannot. make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such answer as i can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,-- o wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? impart. we shall obey, were she ten times our mother. have you any further trade with us? so i do still, by these pickers and stealers. sir, i lack advancement. ay, but sir, 'while the grass grows,'--the proverb is something musty. o, the recorders! let me see one. to withdraw with you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil? i do not well understand that. will you play upon this pipe? i pray you. i do beseech you. 'tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. look you, these are the stops. why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! you would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'sblood, do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe? call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me. god bless you, sir! do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? methinks it is like a weasel. or like a whale? then i will come to my mother by and by. they fool me to the top of my bent. i will come by and by. by and by is easily said. leave me, friends. tis now the very witching time of night, when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world: now could i drink hot blood, and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on. soft! now to my mother. o heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom: let me be cruel, not unnatural: i will speak daggers to her, but use none; my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; how in my words soever she be shent, to give them seals never, my soul, consent! now might i do it pat, now he is praying; and now i'll do't. and so he goes to heaven; and so am i revenged. that would be scann'd: a villain kills my father; and for that, i, his sole son, do this same villain send to heaven. o, this is hire and salary, not revenge. he took my father grossly, full of bread; with all his crimes broad blown, as flush as may; and how his audit stands who knows save heaven? but in our circumstance and course of thought, 'tis heavy with him: and am i then revenged, to take him in the purging of his soul, when he is fit and season'd for his passage? no! up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: when he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; at gaming, swearing, or about some act that has no relish of salvation in't; then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, and that his soul may be as damn'd and black as hell, whereto it goes. my mother stays: this physic but prolongs thy sickly days.   mother, mother, mother! now, mother, what's the matter? mother, you have my father much offended. go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. what's the matter now? no, by the rood, not so: you are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; and--would it were not so!--you are my mother. come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you.   how now! a rat? dead, for a ducat, dead! nay, i know not: is it the king? a bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother, as kill a king, and marry with his brother. ay, lady, 'twas my word. thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! i took thee for thy better: take thy fortune; thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down, and let me wring your heart; for so i shall, if it be made of penetrable stuff, if damned custom have not brass'd it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense. such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty, calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows as false as dicers' oaths: o, such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul, and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow: yea, this solidity and compound mass, with tristful visage, as against the doom, is thought-sick at the act. look here, upon this picture, and on this, the counterfeit presentment of two brothers. see, what a grace was seated on this brow; hyperion's curls; the front of jove himself; an eye like mars, to threaten and command; a station like the herald mercury new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; a combination and a form indeed, where every god did seem to set his seal, to give the world assurance of a man: this was your husband. look you now, what follows: here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, blasting his wholesome brother. have you eyes? could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, and batten on this moor? ha! have you eyes? you cannot call it love; for at your age the hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, and waits upon the judgment: and what judgment would step from this to this? sense, sure, you have, else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd but it reserved some quantity of choice, to serve in such a difference. what devil was't that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind? eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope. o shame! where is thy blush? rebellious hell, if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, to flaming youth let virtue be as wax, and melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge, since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will. nay, but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love over the nasty sty,-- a murderer and a villain; a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; a cutpurse of the empire and the rule, that from a shelf the precious diadem stole, and put it in his pocket! a king of shreds and patches,-- save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, you heavenly guards! what would your gracious figure? do you not come your tardy son to chide, that, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by the important acting of your dread command? o, say! how is it with you, lady? on him, on him! look you, how pale he glares! his form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, would make them capable. do not look upon me; lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects: then what i have to do will want true colour; tears perchance for blood. do you see nothing there? nor did you nothing hear? why, look you there! look, how it steals away! my father, in his habit as he lived! look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! ecstasy! my pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, and makes as healthful music: it is not madness that i have utter'd: bring me to the test, and i the matter will re-word; which madness would gambol from. mother, for love of grace, lay not that mattering unction to your soul, that not your trespass, but my madness speaks: it will but skin and film the ulcerous place, whilst rank corruption, mining all within, infects unseen. confess yourself to heaven; repent what's past; avoid what is to come; and do not spread the compost on the weeds, to make them ranker. forgive me this my virtue; for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. o, throw away the worser part of it, and live the purer with the other half. good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed; assume a virtue, if you have it not. that monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, of habits devil, is angel yet in this, that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery, that aptly is put on. refrain to-night, and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence: the next more easy; for use almost can change the stamp of nature, and either ... the devil, or throw him out with wondrous potency. once more, good night: and when you are desirous to be bless'd, i'll blessing beg of you. for this same lord, i do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so, to punish me with this and this with me, that i must be their scourge and minister. i will bestow him, and will answer well the death i gave him. so, again, good night. i must be cruel, only to be kind: thus bad begins and worse remains behind. one word more, good lady. not this, by no means, that i bid you do: let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; and let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, make you to ravel all this matter out, that i essentially am not in madness, but mad in craft. 'twere good you let him know; for who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, such dear concernings hide? who would do so? no, in despite of sense and secrecy, unpeg the basket on the house's top. let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, to try conclusions, in the basket creep, and break your own neck down. i must to england; you know that? there's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, whom i will trust as i will adders fang'd, they bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, and marshal me to knavery. let it work; for 'tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines, and blow them at the moon: o, 'tis most sweet, when in one line two crafts directly meet. this man shall set me packing: i'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. mother, good night. indeed this counsellor is now most still, most secret and most grave, who was in life a foolish prating knave. come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. good night, mother. safely stowed. what noise? who calls on hamlet? o, here they come. compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin. do not believe it. that i can keep your counsel and not mine own. besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king? ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. but such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again. i am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear. the body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. the king is a thing-- of nothing: bring me to him. hide fox, and all after. at supper. not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table: that's the end. a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. in heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself. but indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby. he will stay till ye come. for england! good. i see a cherub that sees them. but, come; for england! farewell, dear mother. my mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. come, for england! good sir, whose powers are these? how purposed, sir, i pray you? who commands them, sir? goes it against the main of poland, sir, or for some frontier? why, then the polack never will defend it. two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw: this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, that inward breaks, and shows no cause without why the man dies. i humbly thank you, sir. i'll be with you straight go a little before. how all occasions do inform against me, and spur my dull revenge! what is a man, if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. sure, he that made us with such large discourse, looking before and after, gave us not that capability and god-like reason to fust in us unused. now, whether it be bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event, a thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward, i do not know why yet i live to say 'this thing's to do;' sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do't. examples gross as earth exhort me: witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince, whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd makes mouths at the invisible event, exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and danger dare, even for an egg-shell. rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument, but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour's at the stake. how stand i then, that have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, excitements of my reason and my blood, and let all sleep? while, to my shame, i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men, that, for a fantasy and trick of fame, go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain? o, from this time forth, my thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making? 'tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense. that skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! it might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent god, might it not? or of a courtier; which could say 'good morrow, sweet lord! how dost thou, good lord?' this might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not? why, e'en so: and now my lady worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't. did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't. there's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? hum! this fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? is not parchment made of sheepskins? they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. i will speak to this fellow. whose grave's this, sirrah? i think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't. 'thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. what man dost thou dig it for? what woman, then? who is to be buried in't? how absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. by the lord, horatio, these three years i have taken a note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he gaffs his kibe. how long hast thou been a grave-maker? how long is that since? ay, marry, why was he sent into england? why? how came he mad? how strangely? upon what ground? how long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot? why he more than another? whose was it? nay, i know not. this? let me see. alas, poor yorick! i knew him, horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at it. here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft. where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that. prithee, horatio, tell me one thing. dost thou think alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth? and smelt so? pah! to what base uses we may return, horatio! why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole? no, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: alexander died, alexander was buried, alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel? imperious caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, might stop a hole to keep the wind away: o, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw! but soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king. the queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? and with such maimed rites? this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate. couch we awhile, and mark. that is laertes, a very noble youth: mark. what, the fair ophelia!      what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand like wonder-wounded hearers? this is i, hamlet the dane. thou pray'st not well. i prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; for, though i am not splenitive and rash, yet have i something in me dangerous, which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand. why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag. i loved ophelia: forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love, make up my sum. what wilt thou do for her? 'swounds, show me what thou'lt do: woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? i'll do't. dost thou come here to whine? to outface me with leaping in her grave? be buried quick with her, and so will i: and, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw millions of acres on us, till our ground, singeing his pate against the burning zone, make ossa like a wart! nay, an thou'lt mouth, i'll rant as well as thou. hear you, sir; what is the reason that you use me thus? i loved you ever: but it is no matter; let hercules himself do what he may, the cat will mew and dog will have his day. so much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; you do remember all the circumstance? sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, that would not let me sleep: methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes. rashly, and praised be rashness for it, let us know, our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, when our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us there's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will,-- up from my cabin, my sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark groped i to find out them; had my desire. finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew to mine own room again; making so bold, my fears forgetting manners, to unseal their grand commission; where i found, horatio,-- o royal knavery!--an exact command, larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark's health and england's too, with, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, that, on the supervise, no leisure bated, no, not to stay the grinding of the axe, my head should be struck off. here's the commission: read it at more leisure. but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed? being thus be-netted round with villanies,-- ere i could make a prologue to my brains, they had begun the play--i sat me down, devised a new commission, wrote it fair: i once did hold it, as our statists do, a baseness to write fair and labour'd much how to forget that learning, but, sir, now it did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote? an earnest conjuration from the king, as england was his faithful tributary, as love between them like the palm might flourish, as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities, and many such-like 'as'es of great charge, that, on the view and knowing of these contents, without debatement further, more or less, he should the bearers put to sudden death, not shriving-time allow'd. why, even in that was heaven ordinant. i had my father's signet in my purse, which was the model of that danish seal; folded the writ up in form of the other, subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely, the changeling never known. now, the next day was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent thou know'st already. why, man, they did make love to this employment; they are not near my conscience; their defeat does by their own insinuation grow: 'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites. does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon-- he that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, popp'd in between the election and my hopes, thrown out his angle for my proper life, and with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience, to quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, to let this canker of our nature come in further evil? it will be short: the interim is mine; and a man's life's no more than to say 'one.' but i am very sorry, good horatio, that to laertes i forgot myself; for, by the image of my cause, i see the portraiture of his: i'll court his favours. but, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion. i humbly thank you, sir. dost know this water-fly? thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. he hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as i say, spacious in the possession of dirt. i will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. no, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly. but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. i beseech you, remember-- sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, i know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. but, in the verity of extolment, i take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more. the concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath? what imports the nomination of this gentleman? of him, sir. i would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. well, sir? i dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself. what's his weapon? that's two of his weapons: but, well. what call you the carriages? the phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides: i would it might be hangers till then. but, on: six barbary horses against six french swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the french bet against the danish. why is this 'imponed,' as you call it? how if i answer 'no'? sir, i will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, i will win for him an i can; if not, i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. to this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. yours, yours. he does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn. he did comply with his dug, before he sucked it. thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. i am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided i be so able as now. in happy time. she well instructs me. i do not think so: since he went into france, i have been in continual practise: i shall win at the odds. but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter. it is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman. not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. if it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes? give me your pardon, sir: i've done you wrong; but pardon't, as you are a gentleman. this presence knows, and you must needs have heard, how i am punish'd with sore distraction. what i have done, that might your nature, honour and exception roughly awake, i here proclaim was madness. was't hamlet wrong'd laertes? never hamlet: if hamlet from himself be ta'en away, and when he's not himself does wrong laertes, then hamlet does it not, hamlet denies it. who does it, then? his madness: if't be so, hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; his madness is poor hamlet's enemy. sir, in this audience, let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts, that i have shot mine arrow o'er the house, and hurt my brother. i embrace it freely; and will this brother's wager frankly play. give us the foils. come on. i'll be your foil, laertes: in mine ignorance your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, stick fiery off indeed. no, by this hand. very well, my lord your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side. this likes me well. these foils have all a length? come on, sir. one. judgment. i'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. come. another hit; what say you? good madam! i dare not drink yet, madam; by and by. come, for the third, laertes: you but dally; i pray you, pass with your best violence; i am afeard you make a wanton of me. nay, come, again. how does the queen? o villany! ho! let the door be lock'd: treachery! seek it out. the point!--envenom'd too! then, venom, to thy work. here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned dane, drink off this potion. is thy union here? follow my mother. heaven make thee free of it! i follow thee. i am dead, horatio. wretched queen, adieu! you that look pale and tremble at this chance, that are but mutes or audience to this act, had i but time--as this fell sergeant, death, is strict in his arrest--o, i could tell you-- but let it be. horatio, i am dead; thou livest; report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied. as thou'rt a man, give me the cup: let go; by heaven, i'll have't. o good horatio, what a wounded name, things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile, and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, to tell my story. what warlike noise is this? o, i die, horatio; the potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit: i cannot live to hear the news from england; but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras: he has my dying voice; so tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, which have solicited. the rest is silence. \""

nay  come  let s go together  well  god a mercy  excellent well  you are a fishmonger  then i would you were so honest a man  ay  sir  to be honest  as this world goes  is to be one man picked out of ten thousand  for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog  being a god kissing carrion   have you a daughter  let her not walk i  the sun  conception is a blessing  but not as your daughter may conceive  friend  look to  t  words  words  words  between who  slanders  sir  for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards  that their faces are wrinkled  their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit  together with most weak hams  all which  sir  though i most powerfully and potently believe  yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down  for yourself  sir  should be old as i am  if like a crab you could go backward  into my grave  you cannot  sir  take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal  except my life  except my life  except my life  these tedious old fools  my excellent good friends  how dost thou  guildenstern  ah  rosencrantz  good lads  how do ye both  nor the soles of her shoe  then you live about her waist  or in the middle of her favours  in the secret parts of fortune  o  most true  she is a strumpet  what s the news  then is doomsday near  but your news is not true  let me question more in particular  what have you  my good friends  deserved at the hands of fortune  that she sends you to prison hither  denmark s a prison  a goodly one  in which there are many confines  wards and dungeons  denmark being one o  the worst  why  then   tis none to you  for there is nothing either good or bad  but thinking makes it so  to me it is a prison  o god  i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space  were it not that i have bad dreams  a dream itself is but a shadow  then are our beggars bodies  and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars  shadows  shall we to the court  for  by my fay  i cannot reason  no such matter  i will not sort you with the rest of my servants  for  to speak to you like an honest man  i am most dreadfully attended  but  in the beaten way of friendship  what make you at elsinore  beggar that i am  i am even poor in thanks  but i thank you  and sure  dear friends  my thanks are too dear a halfpenny  were you not sent for  is it your own inclining  is it a free visitation  come  deal justly with me  come  come  nay  speak  why  any thing  but to the purpose  you were sent for  and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour  i know the good king and queen have sent for you  that you must teach me  but let me conjure you  by the rights of our fellowship  by the consonancy of our youth  by the obligation of our ever preserved love  and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal  be even and direct with me  whether you were sent for  or no    nay  then  i have an eye of you   if you love me  hold not off  i will tell you why  so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery  and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather  i have of late  but wherefore i know not  lost all my mirth  forgone all custom of exercises  and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame  the earth  seems to me a sterile promontory  this most excellent canopy  the air  look you  this brave o erhanging firmament  this majestical roof fretted with golden fire  why  it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours  what a piece of work is a man  how noble in reason  how infinite in faculty  in form and moving how express and admirable  in action how like an angel  in apprehension how like a god  the beauty of the world  the paragon of animals  and yet  to me  what is this quintessence of dust  man delights not me  no  nor woman neither  though by your smiling you seem to say so  why did you laugh then  when i said  man delights not me   he that plays the king shall be welcome  his majesty shall have tribute of me  the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target  the lover shall not sigh gratis  the humourous man shall end his part in peace  the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o  the sere  and the lady shall say her mind freely  or the blank verse shall halt for t  what players are they  how chances it they travel  their residence  both in reputation and profit  was better both ways  do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city  are they so followed  how comes it  do they grow rusty  what  are they children  who maintains  em  how are they escoted  will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing  will they not say afterwards  if they should grow themselves to common players  as it is most like  if their means are no better  their writers do them wrong  to make them exclaim against their own succession  is t possible  do the boys carry it away  it is not very strange  for mine uncle is king of denmark  and those that would make mows at him while my father lived  give twenty  forty  fifty  an hundred ducats a piece for his picture in little   sblood  there is something in this more than natural  if philosophy could find it out  gentlemen  you are welcome to elsinore  your hands  come then  the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony  let me comply with you in this garb  lest my extent to the players  which  i tell you  must show fairly outward  should more appear like entertainment than yours  you are welcome  but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived  i am but mad north north west  when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw  hark you  guildenstern  and you too  at each ear a hearer  that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts  i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players  mark it  you say right  sir  o  monday morning   twas so indeed  my lord  i have news to tell you  when roscius was an actor in rome    buz  buz  then came each actor on his ass    o jephthah  judge of israel  what a treasure hadst thou  why   one fair daughter and no more  the which he loved passing well   am i not i  the right  old jephthah  nay  that follows not  why   as by lot  god wot   and then  you know   it came to pass  as most like it was     the first row of the pious chanson will show you more  for look  where my abridgement comes  you are welcome  masters  welcome  all  i am glad to see thee well  welcome  good friends  o  my old friend  thy face is valenced since i saw thee last  comest thou to beard me in denmark  what  my young lady and mistress  by r lady  your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last  by the altitude of a chopine  pray god  your voice  like apiece of uncurrent gold  be not cracked within the ring  masters  you are all welcome  we ll e en to t like french falconers  fly at any thing we see  we ll have a speech straight  come  give us a taste of your quality  come  a passionate speech  i heard thee speak me a speech once  but it was never acted  or  if it was  not above once  for the play  i remember  pleased not the million   twas caviare to the general  but it was  as i received it  and others  whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine  an excellent play  well digested in the scenes  set down with as much modesty as cunning  i remember  one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury  nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation  but called it an honest method  as wholesome as sweet  and by very much more handsome than fine  one speech in it i chiefly loved   twas aeneas  tale to dido  and thereabout of it especially  where he speaks of priam s slaughter  if it live in your memory  begin at this line  let me see  let me see    the rugged pyrrhus  like the hyrcanian beast     it is not so   it begins with pyrrhus     the rugged pyrrhus  he whose sable arms  black as his purpose  did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse  hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal  head to foot now is he total gules  horridly trick d with blood of fathers  mothers  daughters  sons  baked and impasted with the parching streets  that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lord s murder  roasted in wrath and fire  and thus o er sized with coagulate gore  with eyes like carbuncles  the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks   so  proceed you  it shall to the barber s  with your beard  prithee  say on  he s for a jig or a tale of bawdry  or he sleeps  say on  come to hecuba   the mobled queen    tis well  i ll have thee speak out the rest soon  good my lord  will you see the players well bestowed  do you hear  let them be well used  for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time  after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live  god s bodykins  man  much better  use every man after his desert  and who should  scape whipping  use them after your own honour and dignity  the less they deserve  the more merit is in your bounty  take them in  follow him  friends  we ll hear a play to morrow  dost thou hear me  old friend  can you play the murder of gonzago  we ll ha t to morrow night  you could  for a need  study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines  which i would set down and insert in t  could you not  very well  follow that lord  and look you mock him not  my good friends  i ll leave you till night  you are welcome to elsinore  ay  so  god be wi  ye  now i am alone  o  what a rogue and peasant slave am i  is it not monstrous that this player here  but in a fiction  in a dream of passion  could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wann d  tears in his eyes  distraction in s aspect  a broken voice  and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit  and all for nothing  for hecuba  what s hecuba to him  or he to hecuba  that he should weep for her  what would he do  had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have  he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech  make mad the guilty and appal the free  confound the ignorant  and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears  yet i  a dull and muddy mettled rascal  peak  like john a dreams  unpregnant of my cause  and can say nothing  no  not for a king  upon whose property and most dear life a damn d defeat was made  am i a coward  who calls me villain  breaks my pate across  plucks off my beard  and blows it in my face  tweaks me by the nose  gives me the lie i  the throat  as deep as to the lungs  who does me this  ha   swounds  i should take it  for it cannot be but i am pigeon liver d and lack gall to make oppression bitter  or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave s offal  bloody  bawdy villain  remorseless  treacherous  lecherous  kindless villain  o  vengeance  why  what an ass am i  this is most brave  that i  the son of a dear father murder d  prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell  must  like a whore  unpack my heart with words  and fall a cursing  like a very drab  a scullion  fie upon t  foh  about  my brain  i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions  for murder  though it have no tongue  will speak with most miraculous organ  i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle  i ll observe his looks  i ll tent him to the quick  if he but blench  i know my course  the spirit that i have seen may be the devil  and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape  yea  and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy  as he is very potent with such spirits  abuses me to damn me  i ll have grounds more relative than this  the play  s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king  to be  or not to be  that is the question  whether  tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  or to take arms against a sea of troubles  and by opposing end them  to die  to sleep  no more  and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to   tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d  to die  to sleep  to sleep  perchance to dream  ay  there s the rub  for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil  must give us pause  there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life  for who would bear the whips and scorns of time  the oppressor s wrong  the proud man s contumely  the pangs of despised love  the law s delay  the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes  when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin  who would fardels bear  to grunt and sweat under a weary life  but that the dread of something after death  the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns  puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of  thus conscience does make cowards of us all  and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought  and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry  and lose the name of action   soft you now  the fair ophelia  nymph  in thy orisons be all my sins remember d  i humbly thank you  well  well  well  no  not i  i never gave you aught  ha  ha  are you honest  are you fair  that if you be honest and fair  your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty  ay  truly  for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness  this was sometime a paradox  but now the time gives it proof  i did love you once  you should not have believed me  for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it  i loved you not  get thee to a nunnery  why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners  i am myself indifferent honest  but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me  i am very proud  revengeful  ambitious  with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in  imagination to give them shape  or time to act them in  what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven  we are arrant knaves  all  believe none of us  go thy ways to a nunnery  where s your father  let the doors be shut upon him  that he may play the fool no where but in s own house  farewell  if thou dost marry  i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry  be thou as chaste as ice  as pure as snow  thou shalt not escape calumny  get thee to a nunnery  go  farewell  or  if thou wilt needs marry  marry a fool  for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them  to a nunnery  go  and quickly too  farewell  i have heard of your paintings too  well enough  god has given you one face  and you make yourselves another  you jig  you amble  and you lisp  and nick name god s creatures  and make your wantonness your ignorance  go to  i ll no more on t  it hath made me mad  i say  we will have no more marriages  those that are married already  all but one  shall live  the rest shall keep as they are  to a nunnery  go  speak the speech  i pray you  as i pronounced it to you  trippingly on the tongue  but if you mouth it  as many of your players do  i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines  nor do not saw the air too much with your hand  thus  but use all gently  for in the very torrent  tempest  and  as i may say  the whirlwind of passion  you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness  o  it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters  to very rags  to split the ears of the groundlings  who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise  i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant  it out herods herod  pray you  avoid it  be not too tame neither  but let your own discretion be your tutor  suit the action to the word  the word to the action  with this special o erstep not the modesty of nature  for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing  whose end  both at the first and now  was and is  to hold  as  twere  the mirror up to nature  to show virtue her own feature  scorn her own image  and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure  now this overdone  or come tardy off  though it make the unskilful laugh  cannot but make the judicious grieve  the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others  o  there be players that i have seen play  and heard others praise  and that highly  not to speak it profanely  that  neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian  pagan  nor man  have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well  they imitated humanity so abominably  o  reform it altogether  and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them  for there be of them that will themselves laugh  to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too  though  in the mean time  some necessary question of the play be then to be considered  that s villanous  and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it  go  make you ready  how now  my lord  i will the king hear this piece of work  bid the players make haste  will you two help to hasten them  what ho  horatio  horatio  thou art e en as just a man as e er my conversation coped withal  nay  do not think i flatter  for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits  to feed and clothe thee  why should the poor be flatter d  no  let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp  and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning  dost thou hear  since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish  her election hath seal d thee for herself  for thou hast been as one  in suffering all  that suffers nothing  a man that fortune s buffets and rewards hast ta en with equal thanks  and blest are those whose blood and judgment are so well commingled  that they are not a pipe for fortune s finger to sound what stop she please  give me that man that is not passion s slave  and i will wear him in my heart s core  ay  in my heart of heart  as i do thee   something too much of this    there is a play to night before the king  one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father s death  i prithee  when thou seest that act afoot  even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle  if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech  it is a damned ghost that we have seen  and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan s stithy  give him heedful note  for i mine eyes will rivet to his face  and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming  they are coming to the play  i must be idle  get you a place  excellent  i  faith  of the chameleon s dish  i eat the air  promise crammed  you cannot feed capons so  no  nor mine now  my lord  you played once i  the university  you say  what did you enact  it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there  be the players ready  no  good mother  here s metal more attractive  lady  shall i lie in your lap  i mean  my head upon your lap  do you think i meant country matters  that s a fair thought to lie between maids  legs  nothing  who  i  o god  your only jig maker  what should a man do but be merry  for  look you  how cheerfully my mother looks  and my father died within these two hours  so long  nay then  let the devil wear black  for i ll have a suit of sables  o heavens  die two months ago  and not forgotten yet  then there s hope a great man s memory may outlive his life half a year  but  by r lady  he must build churches  then  or else shall he suffer not thinking on  with the hobby horse  whose epitaph is  for  o  for  o  the hobby

the duke s name  his wife  baptista  you shall see anon   tis a knavish piece of work  but what o  that  your majesty and we that have free souls  it touches us not  let the galled jade wince  our withers are unwrung  this is one lucianus  nephew to the king  i could interpret between you and your love  if i could see the puppets dallying  it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge  so you must take your husbands  begin  murderer  pox  leave thy damnable faces  and begin  come   the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge   he poisons him i  the garden for s estate  his name s

hart ungalled play  for some must watch  while some must sleep  so runs the world away  would not this  sir  and a forest of feathers   if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me  with two provincial roses on my razed shoes  get me a fellowship in a cry of players  sir  a whole one  i  for thou dost know  o damon dear  this realm dismantled was of jove himself  and now reigns here a very  very  pajock  o good horatio  i ll take the ghost s word for a thousand pound  didst perceive  upon the talk of the poisoning  ah  ha  come  some music  come  the recorders  for if the king like

his doctor  for  for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler  i am tame  sir  pronounce  you are welcome  sir  i cannot  make you a wholesome answer  my wit s diseased  but  sir  such answer as i can make  you shall command  or  rather  as you say  my mother  therefore no more  but to the matter  my mother  you say    o wonderful son  that can so astonish a mother  but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother s admiration  impart  we shall obey  were she ten times our mother  have you any further trade with us  so i do still  by these pickers and stealers  sir  i lack advancement  ay  but sir   while the grass grows    the proverb is something musty  o  the recorders  let me see one  to withdraw with you   why do you go about to recover the wind of me  as if you would drive me into a toil  i do not well understand that  will you play upon this pipe  i pray you  i do beseech you   tis as easy as lying  govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb  give it breath with your mouth  and it will discourse most eloquent music  look you  these are the stops  why  look you now  how unworthy a thing you make of me  you would play upon

little organ  yet cannot you make it speak   sblood  do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe  call me what instrument you will  though you can fret me  yet you cannot play upon me  god

will come by and by  by and by is easily said  leave me  friends  tis now the very witching time of night  when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world  now could i drink hot blood  and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on  soft  now to my mother  o heart  lose not thy nature  let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom  let me be cruel  not unnatural  i will speak daggers to her  but use none  my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites  how in my words soever she be shent  to give them seals never  my soul  consent  now might i do it pat  now he is praying  and now i ll do t  and so he goes to heaven  and so am i revenged  that would be scann d  a villain kills my father  and for that  i  his sole son  do this same villain send to heaven  o  this is hire and salary  not revenge  he took my father grossly  full of bread  with all his crimes broad blown  as flush as may  and how his audit stands who knows save heaven  but in our circumstance and course of thought   tis heavy with him  and am i then revenged  to take him in the purging of his soul  when he is fit and season d for his passage  no  up  sword  and know thou a more horrid hent  when he is drunk asleep  or in his rage  or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed  at gaming  swearing  or about some act that has no relish of salvation in t  then trip him  that his heels may kick at heaven  and that his soul may be as damn d and black as hell  whereto it goes  my mother stays  this physic but prolongs thy sickly days    mother  mother  mother  now  mother

it be made of penetrable stuff  if damned custom have not brass d it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense  such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty  calls virtue hypocrite  takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there  makes marriage vows as false as dicers  oaths  o  such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul  and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words  heaven s face doth glow  yea  this solidity and compound mass  with tristful visage  as against the doom  is thought sick at the act  look here  upon this picture  and on this  the counterfeit presentment of two brothers  see  what a grace was seated on this brow  hyperion s curls  the front of jove himself  an eye like mars  to threaten and command  a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heaven kissing hill  a combination and a form indeed  where every god did seem to set his seal  to give the world assurance of a man  this was your husband  look you now  what follows  here is your husband  like a mildew d ear  blasting his wholesome brother  have you eyes  could you on this fair mountain leave to feed  and batten on this moor  ha  have you eyes  you cannot call it love  for at your age the hey day in the blood is tame  it s humble  and waits upon the judgment  and what judgment would step from this to this  sense  sure  you have  else could you not have motion  but sure  that sense is apoplex d  for madness would not err  nor sense to ecstasy was ne er so thrall d but it reserved some quantity of choice  to serve in such a difference  what devil was t that thus hath cozen d you at hoodman blind  eyes without feeling  feeling without sight  ears without hands or eyes  smelling sans all  or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope  o shame  where is thy blush  rebellious hell  if thou canst mutine in a matron s bones  to flaming youth let virtue be as wax  and melt in her own fire  proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge  since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will  nay  but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed  stew d in corruption  honeying and making love over the nasty sty    a murderer and a villain  a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord  a vice of kings  a cutpurse of the empire and the rule  that from a shelf the precious diadem stole  and put it in his pocket  a king of shreds and patches    save me  and hover o er me with your wings  you heavenly guards  what would your gracious figure  do you not

his form and cause conjoin d  preaching to stones  would make them capable  do not look upon me  lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects  then what i have to do will want true colour  tears perchance for blood  do you see nothing there  nor did you nothing hear  why  look you there  look  how it steals away  my father  in his habit as he lived  look  where he goes  even now  out at the portal  ecstasy  my pulse  as yours  doth temperately keep time  and makes as healthful music  it is not madness that i have utter d  bring me to the test  and i the matter will re word

whilst rank corruption  mining all within  infects unseen  confess yourself to heaven  repent what s past  avoid what is to come  and do not spread the compost on the weeds  to make them ranker  forgive me this my virtue  for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg  yea  curb and woo for leave to do him good  o  throw away the worser part of it  and live the purer with the other half  good night  but go not to mine uncle s bed  assume a virtue  if you have it not  that monster  custom  who all sense doth eat  of habits devil  is angel yet in this  that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery  that aptly is put on  refrain to night  and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence  the next more easy  for use

 when in one line two crafts directly meet  this man shall set me packing  i ll lug the guts into the neighbour room  mother  good night  indeed this counsellor is now most still  most secret and most grave  who was in life a foolish prating knave  come  sir  to draw toward an end with you  good night  mother  safely stowed  what noise  who calls on hamlet  o  here they come  compounded it with dust  whereto  tis kin  do not believe it  that i can keep your counsel and not mine own  besides  to be demanded of a sponge  what replication should be made by the son of a king  ay  sir  that soaks up the king s countenance  his rewards  his authorities  but such officers do the king best service in the end  he keeps them  like an ape  in the corner of his jaw  first mouthed  to be last swallowed  when he needs what you have gleaned  it is but squeezing you  and  sponge  you shall be dry again  i am glad of it  a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear  the body is with the king  but the king is not with the body  the king is a thing   of nothing  bring me to him  hide fox  and all after  at supper  not where he eats  but where he is eaten  a certain convocation of politic worms

but to one table  that s the end  a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king  and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm  nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar  in heaven  send hither to see  if your messenger find him not there  seek him i  the other place yourself  but indeed  if you find him not within this month  you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby  he will stay till ye come  for england  good  i see a cherub that sees them  but  come  for england  farewell  dear mother  my mother  father and mother is man and wife  man and wife is one flesh  and so  my mother  come  for england  good sir  whose powers are these  how purposed  sir  i pray you  who commands them  sir  goes it against the main of poland  sir  or for some frontier  why  then the polack never will defend it  two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw  this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace  that inward breaks  and shows no cause without why the man dies  i humbly thank you  sir  i ll be with you straight go a little before  how all occasions do inform against me  and spur my dull revenge  what is a man  if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed  a beast  no more  sure  he that made us with such large discourse  looking before and after  gave us not that capability and god like reason to fust in us unused  now  whether it be bestial oblivion  or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event  a thought which  quarter d  hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward  i do not know why yet i live to say  this thing s to do   sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do t  examples gross as earth exhort me  witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince  whose spirit with divine ambition puff d makes mouths at the invisible event  exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune  death and danger dare  even for an egg shell  rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument  but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour s at the stake  how stand i then  that have a father kill d  a mother stain d  excitements of my reason and my blood  and let all sleep  while  to my shame  i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men  that  for a fantasy and trick of fame  go to their graves like beds  fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause  which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain  o  from this time forth  my thoughts be bloody  or be nothing worth  has this fellow no feeling of his business  that he sings at grave making   tis e en so  the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense  that skull had a tongue in it  and could sing once  how the knave jowls it to the ground  as if it were cain s jaw bone  that did the first murder  it might be the pate of a politician  which this ass now o er reaches  one that would circumvent god  might it not  or of a courtier  which could say  good morrow  sweet lord  how dost thou  good lord   this might be my lord such a one  that praised my lord such a one s horse  when he meant to beg it  might it not  why  e en so  and now my lady worm s  chapless  and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton s spade  here s fine revolution  an we had the trick to see t  did these bones cost no more the breeding  but to play at loggats with  em  mine ache to think on t  there s another  why may not that be the skull of a lawyer  where be his quiddities now  his quillets  his cases  his tenures  and his tricks  why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel  and will not tell him of his action of battery  hum  this fellow might be in s time a great buyer of land  with his statutes  his recognizances  his fines  his double vouchers  his recoveries  is this the fine of his fines  and the recovery of his recoveries  to have his fine pate full of fine dirt  will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases  and double ones too  than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures  the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box  and must the inheritor himself have no more  ha  is not parchment made of sheepskins  they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that  i will speak to this fellow  whose grave s this  sirrah  i think it be thine  indeed  for thou liest in t   thou dost lie in t  to be in t and say it is thine   tis for the dead  not for the quick  therefore thou liest  what man dost thou dig it for  what woman  then  who is to be buried in t  how absolute the knave is  we must speak by the card  or equivocation will undo us  by the lord  horatio  these three years i have taken a note of it  the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier  he gaffs his kibe  how long hast thou been a grave maker  how long is that since  ay  marry  why was he sent into england  why  how came he mad  how strangely  upon what ground  how long will a man lie i  the earth ere he rot  why he more than another  whose was it  nay  i know not  this  let me see  alas  poor yorick  i knew him  horatio  a fellow of infinite jest  of most excellent fancy  he hath borne me on his back a thousand times  and now  how abhorred in my imagination it is  my gorge rims at it  here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft  where be your gibes now  your gambols  your songs  your flashes of merriment  that were wont to set the table on a roar  not one now  to mock your own grinning  quite chap fallen  now get you to my lady s chamber  and tell her  let her paint an inch thick  to this favour she must come  make her laugh at that  prithee  horatio  tell me one thing  dost thou think alexander looked o  this fashion i  the earth  and smelt so  pah  to what base uses we may return  horatio  why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander  till he find it stopping a bung hole  no  faith  not a jot  but to follow him thither with modesty enough  and likelihood to lead it  as thus  alexander died  alexander was buried  alexander returneth into dust  the dust is earth  of earth we make loam  and why of that loam  whereto he was converted  might they not stop a beer barrel  imperious caesar  dead and turn d to clay  might stop a hole to keep the wind away  o  that that earth  which kept the world in awe  should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw  but soft  but soft  aside  here comes the king  the queen  the courtiers  who is this they follow  and with such maimed rites  this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life   twas of some estate  couch we awhile  and mark  that is laertes  a very noble youth  mark  what  the fair ophelia       what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis  whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars  and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers  this is i  hamlet the dane  thou pray st not well  i prithee  take thy fingers from my throat  for  though i am not splenitive and rash  yet have i something in me dangerous  which let thy wiseness fear  hold off thy hand  why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag  i loved ophelia  forty thousand brothers could not  with all their quantity of love  make up my sum  what wilt thou do for her   swounds  show me what thou lt do  woo t weep  woo t fight  woo t fast  woo t tear thyself  woo t drink up eisel  eat a crocodile  i ll do t  dost thou come here to whine  to outface me with leaping in her grave  be buried quick with her  and so will i  and  if thou prate of mountains  let them throw millions of acres on us  till our ground  singeing his pate against the burning zone  make ossa like a wart  nay  an thou lt mouth  i ll rant as well as thou  hear you  sir  what is the reason that you use me thus  i loved you ever  but it is no matter  let hercules himself do what he may  the cat will mew and dog will have his day  so much for this  sir  now shall you see the other  you do remember all the circumstance  sir  in my heart there was a kind of fighting  that would not let me sleep  methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes  rashly  and praised be rashness for it  let us know  our indiscretion sometimes serves us well  when our deep plots do pall  and that should teach us there s a divinity that shapes our ends  rough hew them how we will    up from my cabin  my sea gown scarf d about me  in the dark groped i to find out them  had my desire  finger d their packet  and in fine withdrew to mine own room again  making so bold  my fears forgetting manners  to unseal their grand commission  where i found  horatio    o royal knavery   an exact command  larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark s health and england s too  with  ho  such bugs and goblins in my life  that  on the supervise  no leisure bated  no  not to stay the grinding of the axe  my head should be struck off  here s the commission  read it at more leisure  but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed  being thus be netted round with villanies    ere i could make a prologue to my brains  they had begun the play  i sat me down  devised a new commission  wrote it fair  i once did hold it  as our statists do  a baseness to write fair and labour d much how to forget that learning  but  sir  now it did me yeoman s service  wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote  an earnest conjuration from the king  as england was his faithful tributary  as love between them like the palm might flourish  as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma  tween their amities  and many such like  as es of great charge  that  on the view and knowing of these contents  without debatement further  more or less  he should the bearers put to sudden death  not shriving time allow d  why  even in that was heaven ordinant  i had my father s signet in my purse  which was the model of that danish seal  folded the writ up in form of the other  subscribed it  gave t the impression  placed it safely  the changeling never known  now  the next day was our sea fight  and what to this was sequent thou know st already  why  man  they did make love to this employment  they are not near my conscience  their defeat does by their own insinuation grow   tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites  does it not  think st thee  stand me now upon   he that hath kill d my king and whored my mother  popp d in between the election and my hopes  thrown out his angle for my proper life  and with such cozenage  is t not perfect conscience  to quit him with this arm  and is t not to be damn d  to let this canker of our nature come in further evil  it will be short  the interim is mine  and a man s life s no more than to say  one   but i am very sorry  good horatio  that to laertes i forgot myself  for  by the image of my cause  i see the portraiture of his  i ll court his favours  but  sure  the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion  i humbly thank you  sir  dost know this water fly  thy state is the more gracious  for  tis a vice to know him  he hath much land  and fertile  let a beast be lord of beasts  and his crib shall stand at the king s mess   tis a chough  but  as i say  spacious in the possession of dirt  i will receive it  sir  with all diligence of spirit  put your bonnet to his right use   tis for the head  no  believe me   tis very cold  the wind is northerly  but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion  i beseech you  remember   sir  his definement suffers no perdition in you  though  i know  to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory  and yet but yaw neither  in respect of his quick sail  but  in the verity of extolment  i take him to be a soul of great article  and his infusion of such dearth and rareness  as  to make true diction of him  his semblable is his mirror  and who else would trace him  his umbrage  nothing more  the concernancy  sir  why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath  what imports the nomination of this gentleman  of him  sir  i would you did  sir  yet  in faith  if you did  it would not much approve me  well  sir  i dare not confess that  lest i should compare with him in excellence  but  to know a man well  were to know himself  what s his weapon  that s two of his weapons  but  well  what call you the carriages  the phrase would be more german to the matter  if we could carry cannon by our sides  i would it might be hangers till then  but  on  six barbary horses against six french swords  their assigns  and three liberal conceited carriages  that s the french bet against the danish  why is this  imponed   as you call it  how if i answer  no   sir  i will walk here in the hall  if it please his majesty   tis the breathing time of day with me  let the foils be brought  the gentleman willing  and the king hold his purpose  i will win for him an i can  if not  i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits  to this effect  sir  after what flourish your nature will  yours  yours  he does well to commend it himself  there are no tongues else for s turn  he did comply with his dug  before he sucked it  thus has he  and many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes on  only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter  a kind of yesty collection  which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions  and do but blow them to their trial  the bubbles are out  i am constant to my purpose  they follow the king s pleasure  if his fitness speaks  mine is ready  now or whensoever  provided i be so able as now  in happy time  she well instructs me  i do not think so  since he went into france  i have been in continual practise  i shall win at the odds  but thou wouldst not think how ill all s here about my heart  but it is no matter  it is but foolery  but it is such a kind of gain giving  as would perhaps trouble a woman  not a whit  we defy augury  there s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow  if it be now   tis not to come  if it be not to come  it will be now  if it be not now  yet it will come  the readiness is all  since no man has aught of what he leaves  what is t to leave betimes  give me your pardon  sir  i ve done you wrong  but pardon t  as you are a gentleman  this presence knows  and you must needs have heard  how i am punish d with sore distraction  what i have done  that might your nature  honour and exception roughly awake  i here proclaim was madness  was t hamlet wrong d laertes  never hamlet  if hamlet from himself be ta en away  and when he s not himself does wrong laertes  then hamlet does it not  hamlet denies it  who does it  then  his madness  if t be so  hamlet is of the faction that is wrong d  his madness is poor hamlet s enemy  sir  in this audience  let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts  that i have shot mine arrow o er the house  and hurt my brother  i embrace it freely  and will this brother s wager frankly play  give us the foils  come on  i ll be your foil  laertes  in mine ignorance your skill shall  like a star i  the darkest night  stick fiery off indeed  no  by this hand  very well  my lord your grace hath laid the odds o  the weaker side  this likes me well  these foils have all a length  come on  sir  one  judgment  i ll play this bout first  set it by awhile  come  another hit  what say you  good madam  i dare not drink yet  madam  by and by  come  for the third  laertes  you but dally  i pray you  pass with your best violence  i am afeard you make a wanton of me  nay  come  again  how does the queen  o villany  ho  let the door be lock d  treachery  seek it out  the point   envenom d too  then  venom  to thy work  here  thou incestuous  murderous  damned dane  drink off this potion  is thy union here  follow my mother  heaven make thee free of it  i follow thee  i am dead  horatio  wretched queen  adieu  you that look pale and tremble at this chance  that are but mutes or audience to this act  had i but time  as this fell sergeant  death  is strict in his arrest  o  i could tell you   but let it be  horatio  i am dead  thou livest  report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied  as thou rt a man  give me the cup  let go  by heaven  i ll have t  o good horatio  what a wounded name  things standing thus unknown  shall live behind me  if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile  and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain  to tell my story  what warlike noise is this  o  i die  horatio  the potent poison quite o er crows my spirit  i cannot live to hear the news from england  but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras  he has my dying voice  so tell him  with the occurrents  more and less  which have solicited  the rest is silence  '"
